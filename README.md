### Project Description
The seat war is nothing but a fun online seat booking platform where the seats which are booked are not shown! So people can book any seat. And the seats once booked when booked again will lead to collision. That collision is resolved by playing random games between the seat bookers. The one who wins the game wins the seat! Also, the seat won by the winner may or maynot be the same.
### The Problem (that doesn't exist)
People who would book the same seats at a thetre/a concert should be given a fair chance of winning the seat irrespective of the time and place they book.
### The Solution (that nobody asked for)
We would force them to play a game so that the winner is given the seat. Also just to keep the thrill, the winner is given a random seat.
